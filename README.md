Paper in english published on "Revista Livre de Sustentabilidade e Empreendedorismo" from Brazil (https://www.relise.eco.br/index.php/relise/article/view/920/956).

Developed in 2022-2023 in collaboration with Erinaldo Nascimento, MSc and Camila Miranda, PhD as part of my electrical engineering BSc final paper.

Abstract:

This paper proposes the planning of a fictitious company that manufactures thermocirculators, including a business model and a business plan, brand, and conclusions about its viability. Studies indicate that only 37.6% of companies founded in 2014 surviveduntil 2019, and lack of planning is one of the main reasons that lead to the early closure of companies, making it important to make an adequate business planning. Using the Canvas methodology and the manual proposed by Sebrae, the business model and business plan were prepared, respectively. Based on market research, an initial investment of R$23,061.00 and an initial production of 50 thermocirculators with a selling price of R$700.00 per unit were estimated. The SWOT analysis pointed out two threats: competition from consolidated companies and low market demand, in addition to a weakness in product differentiation. Therefore, it is concluded that opening a thermocirculator manufacturing company is unfeasible in this context.
